After preprocessing using linear regression for age imputation, filling na values and adjusting outliers I tested 6 different classification algorithms on the training data. Logistic Regression proved to be the best out of the six algorithms and I used it for prediction. There is a lot of room to improve with the recall score of survivors, and improving that may have to do with filling and making use of the Cabin dimension, along with tuning the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression or other algorithms.
